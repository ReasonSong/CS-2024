//
// (Account Inheritance Hierarchy) Create an inheritance hierarchy that a bank might use to
// represent customersâ€™ bank accounts. All customers at this bank can deposit (i.e., credit)
// money into their accounts and withdraw (i.e., debit) money from their accounts.
// More specific types of accounts also exist. Savings accounts, for instance, earn interest
// on the money they hold. Checking accounts, on the other hand, charge a fee per transaction.
//
// Class Account, SavingAccount, CheckingAccount are declared and defined in BankAccount.hpp and
// implemented in BankAccount.cpp.
//
// Tests code is written in the main() function.
//
// Compiled by Xcode.
